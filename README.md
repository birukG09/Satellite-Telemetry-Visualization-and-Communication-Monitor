Satellite Telemetry Visualization and Communication Monitor

Real-time satellite tracking meets cyberpunk aesthetics.

🚀 Project Overview
This application provides a real-time tracking and visualization system for satellites around the Earth. It combines:

Advanced satellite telemetry data processing (using TLE data and orbital calculations),

Cyberpunk-themed interactive 3D globe and 2D maps with neon green & black hacker console style,

Live updates via WebSocket,

Detailed satellite telemetry charts and filters,

And a robust backend API with data storage in PostgreSQL/PostGIS.

🎯 Goals
Visualize satellite orbits and telemetry live on a 3D globe and 2D map.

Provide an immersive hacker console UI with animations, glow effects, and interactive elements.

Support real-time telemetry updates and historical playback.

Showcase clean, modular architecture in backend and frontend.

Deployable via Docker and cloud services.
